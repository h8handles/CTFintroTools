This is a basic configuration script with more features being added as we speak.

This will go through a list of apt installs and git clones to get tools not standardly packaged with
kali or parot.



There are some commented lines in the code that are optional and will take a little of time to run
being large repos.

Added some tools and a honeypot

Run both bash scripts

sudo ./create.sh
sudo ./require.sh

this should be all you need so far. feel free to add a branch and populate the script with things you like. I am adding to it as I go.

thanks a bunch!
